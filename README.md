# Random-Messages: Featured Artist
Enriching your music taste day by day

## What does it do?
"Featured Artist" recommends people with no taste new artists to discover.
The program will give you the daily artist, an album of his and a song from that album.

## Features
My program features at the moment 10 individual artists with my top pick albums to each artist and the full playlist of that album.

## How to use
**Please note** you will need *Node.js* to run the program.

# Adding new artists
You can add new artists by using the artistFactory function in this way:

<sub>
const art1 = artistFactory('Artist-name',[
    ['album1',['Song 1','Song 2','Song 3']],
    ['album2',['Song 1','Song 2','Song 3']],
    ['album3',['Song 1','Song 2','Song 3']]]);
</sub>

**Enjoy!**
